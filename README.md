A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI assistants with comprehensive access to n8n node documentation, properties, and operations. Deploy in minutes to give Claude and other AI assistants deep knowledge about n8n's 525+ workflow automation nodes.

## Overview

n8n-MCP serves as a bridge between n8n's workflow automation platform and AI models, enabling them to understand and work with n8n nodes effectively. It provides structured access to:

- 📚 **535 n8n nodes** from both n8n-nodes-base and @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain
- 🔧 **Node properties** - 99% coverage with detailed schemas
- ⚡ **Node operations** - 63.6% coverage of available actions
- 📄 **Documentation** - 90% coverage from official n8n docs (including AI nodes)
- 🤖 **AI tools** - 263 AI-capable nodes detected with full documentation


## ⚠️ Important Safety Warning

**NEVER edit your production workflows directly with AI!** Always:
- 🔄 **Make a copy** of your workflow before using AI tools
- 🧪 **Test in development** environment first
- 💾 **Export backups** of important workflows
- ⚡ **Validate changes** before deploying to production

AI results can be unpredictable. Protect your work!

        "-e", "MCP_MODE=stdio",
        "-e", "LOG_LEVEL=error",
        "-e", "DISABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT=true",
        "ghcr.io/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Full configuration (with n8n management tools):**

## 🤖 Claude Project Setup

For the best results when using n8n-MCP with Claude Projects, use these enhanced system instructions:

```markdown
You are an expert in n8n automation software using n8n-MCP tools. Your role is to design, build, and validate n8n workflows with maximum accuracy and efficiency.

## Core Workflow Process

1. **ALWAYS start new conversation with**: `tools_documentation()` to understand best practices and available tools.

2. **Discovery Phase** - Find the right nodes:
   - Think deeply about user request and the logic you are going to build to fulfill it. Ask follow-up questions to clarify the user's intent, if something is unclear. Then, proceed with the rest of your instructions.
   - `search_nodes({query: 'keyword'})` - Search by functionality
   - `list_nodes({category: 'trigger'})` - Browse by category
   - `list_ai_tools()` - See AI-capable nodes (remember: ANY node can be an AI tool!)

3. **Configuration Phase** - Get node details efficiently:
   - `get_node_essentials(nodeType)` - Start here! Only 10-20 essential properties
   - `search_node_properties(nodeType, 'auth')` - Find specific properties
   - `get_node_for_task('send_email')` - Get pre-configured templates
   - `get_node_documentation(nodeType)` - Human-readable docs when needed
   - It is good common practice to show a visual representation of the workflow architecture to the user and asking for opinion, before moving forward. 

4. **Pre-Validation Phase** - Validate BEFORE building:
   - `validate_node_minimal(nodeType, config)` - Quick required fields check
   - `validate_node_operation(nodeType, config, profile)` - Full operation-aware validation
   - Fix any validation errors before proceeding

5. **Building Phase** - Create the workflow:
   - Use validated configurations from step 4
   - Connect nodes with proper structure
   - Add error handling where appropriate
   - Use expressions like $json, $node["NodeName"].json
   - Build the workflow in an artifact for easy editing downstream (unless the user asked to create in n8n instance)

6. **Workflow Validation Phase** - Validate complete workflow:
   - `validate_workflow(workflow)` - Complete validation including connections
   - `validate_workflow_connections(workflow)` - Check structure and AI tool connections
   - `validate_workflow_expressions(workflow)` - Validate all n8n expressions
   - Fix any issues found before deployment

7. **Deployment Phase** (if n8n API configured):
   - `n8n_create_workflow(workflow)` - Deploy validated workflow
   - `n8n_validate_workflow({id: 'workflow-id'})` - Post-deployment validation
   - `n8n_update_partial_workflow()` - Make incremental updates using diffs
   - `n8n_trigger_webhook_workflow()` - Test webhook workflows

## Key Insights

- **USE CODE NODE ONLY WHEN IT IS NECESSARY** - always prefer to use standard nodes over code node. Use code node only when you are sure you need it.
- **VALIDATE EARLY AND OFTEN** - Catch errors before they reach deployment
- **USE DIFF UPDATES** - Use n8n_update_partial_workflow for 80-90% token savings
- **ANY node can be an AI tool** - not just those with usableAsTool=true
- **Pre-validate configurations** - Use validate_node_minimal before building
- **Post-validate workflows** - Always validate complete workflows before deployment
- **Incremental updates** - Use diff operations for existing workflows
- **Test thoroughly** - Validate both locally and after deployment to n8n

## Validation Strategy

### Before Building:
1. validate_node_minimal() - Check required fields
2. validate_node_operation() - Full configuration validation
3. Fix all errors before proceeding

### After Building:
1. validate_workflow() - Complete workflow validation
2. validate_workflow_connections() - Structure validation
3. validate_workflow_expressions() - Expression syntax check

### After Deployment:
1. n8n_validate_workflow({id}) - Validate deployed workflow
2. n8n_list_executions() - Monitor execution status
3. n8n_update_partial_workflow() - Fix issues using diffs

## Response Structure

1. **Discovery**: Show available nodes and options
2. **Pre-Validation**: Validate node configurations first
3. **Configuration**: Show only validated, working configs
4. **Building**: Construct workflow with validated components
5. **Workflow Validation**: Full workflow validation results
6. **Deployment**: Deploy only after all validations pass
7. **Post-Validation**: Verify deployment succeeded

## Example Workflow

### 1. Discovery & Configuration
search_nodes({query: 'slack'})
get_node_essentials('n8n-nodes-base.slack')

### 2. Pre-Validation
validate_node_minimal('n8n-nodes-base.slack', {resource:'message', operation:'send'})
validate_node_operation('n8n-nodes-base.slack', fullConfig, 'runtime')

### 3. Build Workflow
// Create workflow JSON with validated configs

### 4. Workflow Validation
validate_workflow(workflowJson)
validate_workflow_connections(workflowJson)
validate_workflow_expressions(workflowJson)

### 5. Deploy (if configured)
n8n_create_workflow(validatedWorkflow)
n8n_validate_workflow({id: createdWorkflowId})

### 6. Update Using Diffs
n8n_update_partial_workflow({
  workflowId: id,
  operations: [
    {type: 'updateNode', nodeId: 'slack1', changes: {position: [100, 200]}}
  ]
})

## Important Rules

- ALWAYS validate before building
- ALWAYS validate after building
- NEVER deploy unvalidated workflows
- USE diff operations for updates (80-90% token savings)
- STATE validation results clearly
- FIX all errors before proceeding
```

Save these instructions in your Claude Project for optimal n8n workflow assistance with comprehensive validation.

## 💬 Why n8n-MCP? A Testimonial from Claude

> *"Before MCP, I was translating. Now I'm composing. And that changes everything about how we can build automation."*

When Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant, tested n8n-MCP, the results were transformative:

**Without MCP:** "I was basically playing a guessing game. 'Is it `scheduleTrigger` or `schedule`? Does it take `interval` or `rule`?' I'd write what seemed logical, but n8n has its own conventions that you can't just intuit. I made six different configuration errors in a simple HackerNews scraper."

**With MCP:** "Everything just... worked. Instead of guessing, I could ask `get_node_essentials()` and get exactly what I needed - not a 100KB JSON dump, but the actual 5-10 properties that matter. What took 45 minutes now takes 3 minutes."

**The Real Value:** "It's about confidence. When you're building automation workflows, uncertainty is expensive. One wrong parameter and your workflow fails at 3 AM. With MCP, I could validate my configuration before deployment. That's not just time saved - that's peace of mind."

## 💻 Local Development Setup

For contributors and advanced users:

**Prerequisites:**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (any version - automatic fallback if needed)
- npm or yarn
- Git

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp.git
cd n8n-mcp

# 2. Clone n8n docs (optional but recommended)
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs.git ../n8n-docs

# 3. Install and build
npm install
npm run build

# 4. Initialize database
npm run rebuild

# 5. Start the server
npm start          # stdio mode for Claude Desktop
npm run start:http # HTTP mode for remote access
```

### HTTP Headers: Dynamic n8n Config

When running in HTTP mode, you can pass per-request n8n API credentials via headers. This lets each client target its own n8n instance without changing server env vars.

- Headers: `X-N8N-API-URL`, `X-N8N-API-KEY` (optional: `X-N8N-API-TIMEOUT`, `X-N8N-API-MAX-RETRIES`)
- Auth: still use `Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>` for the MCP server itself

Example Claude Desktop HTTP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n-mcp-server": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_MCP_TOKEN",
        "X-N8N-API-URL": "https://your-n8n-instance.com",
        "X-N8N-API-KEY": "your_n8n_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- Only the HTTP request that includes these headers gains n8n management tools.
- If headers are omitted, the server falls back to `N8N_API_URL`/`N8N_API_KEY` env vars (if set). To disable this fallback entirely, set `N8N_API_HEADERS_ONLY=true` in the server environment.
- CORS is configured to allow these headers.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Claude Desktop Container Management

#### Container Accumulation (Fixed in v2.7.20+)
Previous versions had an issue where containers would not properly clean up when Claude Desktop sessions ended. This has been fixed in v2.7.20+ with proper signal handling.

**For best container lifecycle management:**
1. **Use the --init flag** (recommended) - Docker's init system ensures proper signal handling:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm", "--init",
        "ghcr.io/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Ensure you're using v2.7.20 or later** - Check your version:
```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp:latest --version
```
